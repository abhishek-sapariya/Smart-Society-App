# Smart-Society-App
This mobile application is for secretary as well as residents

In this, we have provided online notice board, secretary can send e-receipts of each month (or any duration of the payment of maintenance)
through whatsapp to each resident and also maintain list about who has paid maintenance and when. Secretary can also store these receipts in the device. Resident can register their complaint online and secretary can keep track of them easily. For small issues, we have provided a voting system where each resident can vote and finally by seeing statistics secretary can decide about it. This app solves the main problem of paper receipts by eliminating use of paper receipts and providing e-receipts and also provides above mentioned useful features side by side and helps the secretary and residents maintain the society together.
